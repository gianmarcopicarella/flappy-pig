[Flappy pig](https://github.com/gianmarcopicarella/flappy-pig) is an **Arduino Uno hyper casual game**. It has been developed as a side project during the university class "Arduino and multicore programming" at [Sapienza](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home). It uses [U8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2) to communicate, via the SPI protocol, directly to the screen hardware without worring about low level details.




### Features:
* 8bit sound effects when the player dies or earns a point
* Easy to use controls
* 14fps on average with a clock speed of 16mhz, 2kb of sram and a 1.5inch oled screen
* Compatible with every monochrome SPI Arduino display
